Day 1 (18-01-25): I worked on basic Java problems and mathematical formulas, which helped me understand Java operators better. I also practiced Git Bash commands like initializing, staging, committing, and pushing code.

Day 2 (20-01-25): I completed another Java assignment and studied JVM, JDK, and Java’s key features. I also practiced Git Bash commands to improve my version control skills.

Day 3 (21-01-25): Solve Java problems and studied more about JVM, JDK, and programming elements like comments, data types, variables, operators, type conversion, and user input.

Day 4 (22-01-25): Focuse on Java control flow, including if-else statements, loops (for, while), break and continue, and switch statements.

Day 5 (23-01-25): Learned about Java arrays, how to create and access , modify elements, and use loops to iterate .

Day 6 (24-01-25): Studied multi-dimensional arrays, especially 2D arrays (matrices). I also explored error handling using System.error() and controlled program flow with exit().

Day 7 (27-01-25): Worked on Java methods,  user-defined methods,  and static methods. 

Day 8 (28-01-25): Focuse on Java strings—creating, manipulating, and taking user input. I also explored string arrays, built-in methods, and ASCII character codes.

Day 9 (29-01-25): Learned about Java exceptions, including checked and unchecked exceptions, and practiced exception handling to manage errors effectively.

Day 10 (30-01-25): Studied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), focusing on classes, objects, and methods.

Day 11 (31-01-25): Explored Java constructors, the difference between instance and class variables, and access modifiers like public, private, and protected.

Day 12 (01-02-25): Learned how to write proper Git commit messages using different formats for adding, refactoring, and fixing code.

Day 13 (03-02-25): Studied Java’s static and final keywords and practiced using instanceof to check object types.

Day 14 (04-02-25): Explored the differences between classes and objects using class diagrams, object diagrams, and sequence diagrams.

Day 15 (05-02-25): Focused on Object-Oriented Design, creating diagrams to represent system components and their interactions.

Day 16 (06-02-25): Spent the day reviewing and revising all study material from the last two weeks.

Day 17 (07-02-25): Learned about inheritance in Java,  single-level, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance. I also practiced method overriding, constructor inheritance, and polymorphism to understand code reusability and access control better.

Day 18 (10-02-25): Learned about Submission of Encapsulation in Java, Polymorphism and Interface. I also practiced Abstract Class and use it in coding problems.
