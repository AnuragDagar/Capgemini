Day 1 (18-01-25): I worked on basic Java problems and mathematical formulas, which helped me understand Java operators better. I also practiced Git Bash commands like initializing, staging, committing, and pushing code.

Day 2 (20-01-25): I completed another Java assignment and studied JVM, JDK, and Java’s key features. I also practiced Git Bash commands to improve my version control skills.

Day 3 (21-01-25): Solve Java problems and studied more about JVM, JDK, and programming elements like comments, data types, variables, operators, type conversion, and user input.

Day 4 (22-01-25): Focuse on Java control flow, including if-else statements, loops (for, while), break and continue, and switch statements.

Day 5 (23-01-25): Learned about Java arrays, how to create and access , modify elements, and use loops to iterate .

Day 6 (24-01-25): Studied multi-dimensional arrays, especially 2D arrays (matrices). I also explored error handling using System.error() and controlled program flow with exit().

Day 7 (27-01-25): Worked on Java methods,  user-defined methods,  and static methods. 

Day 8 (28-01-25): Focuse on Java strings—creating, manipulating, and taking user input. I also explored string arrays, built-in methods, and ASCII character codes.

Day 9 (29-01-25): Learned about Java exceptions, including checked and unchecked exceptions, and practiced exception handling to manage errors effectively.

Day 10 (30-01-25): Studied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), focusing on classes, objects, and methods.

Day 11 (31-01-25): Explored Java constructors, the difference between instance and class variables, and access modifiers like public, private, and protected.

Day 12 (01-02-25): Learned how to write proper Git commit messages using different formats for adding, refactoring, and fixing code.

Day 13 (03-02-25): Studied Java’s static and final keywords and practiced using instanceof to check object types.

Day 14 (04-02-25): Explored the differences between classes and objects using class diagrams, object diagrams, and sequence diagrams.

Day 15 (05-02-25): Focused on Object-Oriented Design, creating diagrams to represent system components and their interactions.

Day 16 (06-02-25): Spent the day reviewing and revising all study material from the last two weeks.

Day 17 (07-02-25): Learned about inheritance in Java,  single-level, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance. I also practiced method overriding, constructor inheritance, and polymorphism to understand code reusability and access control better.

Day 18 (10-02-25): Learned about Submission of Encapsulation in Java, Polymorphism and Interface. I also practiced Abstract Class and use it in coding problems.

Day 19 - (Dated :- 12-02-25) :- I studied and completed assignments on the following topics: Single Linked List, Double Linked List, and Circular Linked List. These covered their structures, operations, and applications.

Day 20 - (Dated :- 13-02-25) :- Today, I studied Stack, Queue, and HashMap along with Hashing Functions and completed the assignment based on these topics.

Day 21 - (Dated :- 14-02-25) :- I studied various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort, and applied our understanding by solving related assignments.

Day 22 - (Dated :- 15-02-25) :- I studied  StringBuilder and StringBuffer for efficient string manipulation, and FileReader and InputStreamReader for handling file input operations. I also  studied searching techniques such as Linear Search and Binary Search. I applied these concepts in assignments .

Day 23 - (Dated :- 17-02-25) :- I studied runtime analysis and its importance in evaluating program efficiency. Also explored Big-O notation to classify algorithm performance and analyzed  time and space complexity. I also studied best, worst, and average case complexities .Applied practical guidelines to optimize Java code and solved related problems in the assignment.

Day 24 - (Dated :- 18-02-25) :- I studied Generics in Java, covering Type Parameters for flexibility, Generic Classes and Methods for reusability, Bounded Type Parameters for restricted types, and Wildcards for handling unknown types.

Day 26 - (Dated :- 19-02-25) :- I studied the Java Collections Framework, covering its hierarchy, key interfaces (List, Set, Queue, Deque, Map), implementations, comparisons, and best practices. I explored real-world use cases and reinforced my understanding by solving related questions.

Day 27 - (Dated :- 20-02-25) :- Today, I reviewed Week 3 and revised all topics related to OOP concepts and linked lists.

Day 28 - (Dated :- 21-02-25) :- Java I/O Streams facilitate data transfer via File, Object, ByteArray, Buffered, and Reader/Writer Streams. Key practices include using try-with-resources, optimizing buffering, and closing streams properly. Mastery comes through study and problem-solving.
